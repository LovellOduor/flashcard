#Flashcard App Tunani

The flash card app allows learners to test their knowledge on new concepts they have learned and record them in a question and answer format like:
Question: What is a ViewModel ?
Answer: It's a class that enables state management in android and has it's own independent lifecycle.

##How it works

The app would later at random time intervals ask the learner the question (s) through a notification in a random order, if they get the answer right by recalling mentally, they can click on a tick and gain memory points. If not they click on an X and get negative points. I believe this could enhance learners memory.
In addition to the core feature, users could make their flash cards for a particular topic such as Google Cloud and other users could simply download and use publicly available cards from the online section.
